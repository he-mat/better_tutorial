CALCULATOR - ADDITION

In this program we will be adding the registers EAX and EBX toghether and we'll leave our answer in EAX. Firstly we
use the MOV instruction to load EAX with an integer (in this case 90). We then MOV an integer into EBX (in this case
9). Now all we need to do is use the ADD instruction to perform our addition. EAX & EBX will be added together
leaving our answer in the left most register in this instruction (in our case EAX). Then all we need to do is call
our integer printing function to complete the program.
