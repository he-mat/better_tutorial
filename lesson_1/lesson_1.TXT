HELLO WORLD!
writing our first program:
firstly we will create a variable called msg in our .data section and assign it the string we want to output,
in this case "Hello, World!". In our .text seciton we tell the kernel where to begin execution by providing it
with global label _start: to denote the programs entry point.
We will be using the system call (again, 32bit system call table can be found here: http://syscalls.kernelgrok.com/)
sys_write to output our message to the console window. This function is assigned OPCODE 4 in the Linux System Call
Table. This means that EAX has to contain a 4 in order for the kernel to execute the correct function.
The function also takes three arguments which are sequentially loaded into EBX, ECX, EDX before requesting
a software interrupt which will perform the task.

the arguments are passed as follows:
 EBX will be loaded with the file we want to write to - in this case STDOUT
 ECX will be loaded with the address of our variable created in the .data section (this needs to be a pointer)
 EDX will be loaded with the length (in bytes) of our string

the datatype and meaning can be found in the functions definition in the table provided above (in the form of a link)

We compile, link and run the program using the commands
 $ nasm -f elf lesson_1.asm
 $ ld -m elf_i386 lesson_1.o -o lesson_1
or we could use the compile script that I provided with this package:
 $ compile32 [-dnh] lesson_1
 (use 'compile32 -h' for help)

We run the program with ./lesson_1

-------------------
; Hello World Program
 
SECTION .data
msg     db      'Hello, World!', 0Ah ; assign msg variable with your message string
 
SECTION .text
global  _start
 
_start:
 
    mov     eax, 4      ; invoke SYS_WRITE (kernel OPCODE 4)
    mov     ebx, 1      ; write to the STDOUT file
    mov     ecx, msg    ; move the memory address of our message string into ecx
    mov     edx, 14     ; number of bytes to write - one for each letter plus 0Ah (line feed character)
    int     80h		; perform the syscall

output:
Hello World!
