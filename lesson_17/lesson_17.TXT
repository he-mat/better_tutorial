NAMESPACE

Namespace is a necessary construct in any software project that involves a codebase that is larger than a few simple
functions. Namespace provides scope to your identifiers and allows you to reuse naming conventions to make your code
more readable and maintainable. In assembly language where subroutines are identified by global labels, namespace
can be achieved by using local labels.

Up until the last lesson we have been using global labels exclusively. This means that blocks of logic essentially
perform the same task needed a label with an unique identifier. A good example would be our finished labels. These
were global in scope, meaning when we needed to break out of a loop in one function we could jump to a "finished"
label. But if we needed to break out of a loop in a different function we would need to name this same task
something different, like calling it "done" or "continue". Being able to reuse the label "finished" would mean that
someone reading the code would know that these blokc sof logic perform almost the same task.

Local labels are prepended with a "." at the beginning of their name, for example ".finished". You may have noticed
them appearing as our code base in functions.asm grew. A local label is given the namespace of the first global
label above it. You can jump to a local label by using the JMP instruction and the compiler will calculate which
local label you are referencing by determining in what scope (based on above global labels) the instruction was
called.

NOTE: I changed the functions.asm file to use namespaces as well. If I wouldn't've done that, the program would not
be able to compile due to the compiler not knowing which finished label to go to.
