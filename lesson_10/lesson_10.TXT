COUNT TO 10

Counting by number is not as straight forward as you would think in assembly. Firstly we need to pass SYS_WRITE an
address in memory so we can't just load our register with a number and call our print function. Secondly, numbers
and strings are very different things in assembly. Strings are represented by what are called ASCII values. ASCII
stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A good reference for ASCII can be found here:
http://www.asciitable.com/ . ASCII was created as a way to standardise the representation of strings across all
computers.

Remember, we can't print a number - we have to print a string. In order to count to 10 we will need to convert
our numbers from standard integers to their ASCII string representations. Have a look at the ASCII values table
and notice that the string representation for the number "1" is actually "49" in ASCII. In fact, adding 48 to our
numbers is all we have to do to convert them from integers to ASCII string representations.

What we will do with our program is count from 1 to 10 using the ECX register. We will then ADD 48 to our counter
to convert it from a number to its ASCII string representation. We will then PUSH this value to the stack and call
our print function passing ESP as the memory address to print from. Once we have finished counting to 10 we will
exit our counting loop and call our quit function.
