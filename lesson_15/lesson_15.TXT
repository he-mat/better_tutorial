CALCULATOR - DIVISION

In this program we will be dividing the value in EBX by the value present in EAX. We've used division
before in our integer print subroutine. Our program requires a few extra strings in order to print out the
correct answer but otherwise there's nothing complicated going on.

Firstly we load EAX and EBX with integers in the same way as Lesson 12. Division logic is performed using the DIV
instruction. The DIV instruction always divides EAX by the value passed after it. It will leave the quotient part
of the answer in EAX and put the remainder part in EDX (originally called data register). We then MOV and call our
strings and integers to print out the correct answer.
